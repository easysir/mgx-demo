Here is the collaboration summary from Mike's perspective.\n\n***\n\n**Collaboration Summary for \"hello\"**\n\n**Contributions from Mike:**\n*   Took the lead in drafting the initial version of the \"hello\" module.\n*   Established the core functionality and defined the basic structure for the output.\n*   Performed a preliminary review to ensure the output was clean and met the fundamental requirements.\n\n**Outcome:**\nThe initial build of the \"hello\" module has been successfully completed. It is functional and provides a solid foundation for the project.\n\n**Next Recommended Action:**\nThe module is now ready for peer review and testing. I recommend passing it to the next team member for feedback, quality assurance, and potential enhancements.",
