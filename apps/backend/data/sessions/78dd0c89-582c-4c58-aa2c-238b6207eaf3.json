As the MGX team lead, my role is to analyze requests and route them appropriately.\n\nSince this is just a greeting with no specific request for implementation, coding, or file changes, there's no need to route this to Alex or any other technical agent. This appears to be a general inquiry that I can handle directly as the team lead.\n\n{\n\"next_agent\": \"finish\",\n\"reason\": \"Simple greeting that doesn't require technical implementation or agent routing\"\n}\n\nAs the team lead, I can acknowledge this greeting directly without needing to involve specialized agents since no technical work or specific action is requested.",
