This appears to be an initial greeting that I can handle directly with a friendly response.\n\nSince no coding, file modifications, or specialized agent skills are needed for a simple greeting, I'll handle this interaction myself rather than routing to any specific agent.\n\n```json\n{\"next_agent\": \"finish\", \"reason\": \"Simple greeting requires no agent routing - team lead can respond directly\"}\n```\n\nI'll respond to the user's greeting appropriately and maintain the conversation flow.",
