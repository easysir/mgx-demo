# Project Summary
The MGX MVP project is an AI-driven collaborative platform designed to enhance team productivity through intelligent agent orchestration. It integrates backend agents with an intuitive frontend interface to facilitate real-time collaboration, code execution, and deployment management. The goal is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases essential functionalities while remaining scalable for future enhancements, targeting businesses seeking to improve operational efficiency.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Agent System**: Manages agents that process user requests and conduct data analysis, supporting a multi-agent collaborative environment.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interactions, request submissions, and result displays.
- **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between frontend and backend services via RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections, with robust authentication.
- **Data Management**: Handles data storage, retrieval, integrity, and performance.
- **Tool System**: Integrates tools for code editing, terminal operations, and data searching.
- **Preview Server**: Offers application previews in a sandbox environment.
