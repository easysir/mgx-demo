# Project Summary
The MGX MVP project is an AI-driven collaborative platform aimed at boosting team productivity through intelligent agent orchestration. It integrates backend agents with an intuitive frontend interface, facilitating real-time collaboration, code execution, and deployment management. The project aspires to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that highlights essential functionalities and is designed for scalability to accommodate future enhancements.

# Project Module Description
The project comprises several functional modules:
- **Agent System**: Manages agents that process user requests and conduct data analysis, now enhanced to support a multi-agent collaborative system.
- **Web Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for interactions, request submissions, and result displays.
- **API Layer**: Enables communication between frontend and backend services via RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections, including enhanced authentication mechanisms.
- **Data Management**: Manages data storage, retrieval, integrity, and performance.
- **Tool System**: Integrates tools for code editing, terminal operations, and data searching.
- **Preview Server**: Provides application previews in a sandbox environment.
