# Project Summary
The MGX MVP project is focused on creating an AI-driven collaborative platform that integrates backend agents with a user-friendly frontend interface. This system supports real-time collaboration, code execution, and deployment management, aiming to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases essential functionalities while being scalable for future enhancements.

# Project Module Description
The project comprises several functional modules:
- **Agent System**: Manages a variety of agents that perform tasks like processing user requests, conducting data analysis, and managing system operations.
- **Web Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for interaction, request submission, and result viewing.
- **API Layer**: Enables communication between frontend and backend services via RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
- **Data Management**: Responsible for data storage and retrieval across databases, ensuring data integrity and performance.
- **Tool System**: Integrates various tools for code editing, terminal operations, and data searching.
