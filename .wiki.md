# Project Summary
The MGX MVP project is an AI-powered collaborative platform aimed at enhancing team productivity through intelligent agent orchestration. It integrates backend agents with a user-friendly frontend interface, enabling real-time collaboration, code execution, and deployment management. The objective is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that showcases essential functionalities while allowing for scalability in future updates.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Agent System**: Manages agents responsible for processing user requests and conducting data analysis.
- **Web Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for user interactions, request submissions, and result displays.
- **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between frontend and backend services using RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
- **Data Management**: Ensures data storage, retrieval, integrity, and performance.
- **Tool System**: Integrates tools for code editing, terminal operations, and data searching.
- **Preview Server**: Allows for application previews in a sandbox environment.
