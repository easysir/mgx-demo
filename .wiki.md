# Project Summary
The MGX MVP project is an AI-powered collaborative platform designed to boost team productivity through intelligent agent orchestration. It seamlessly integrates backend agents with an intuitive frontend interface, facilitating real-time collaboration, code execution, and deployment management. The goal is to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that highlights core functionalities while remaining scalable for future enhancements.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Agent System**: Oversees agents that manage tasks like processing user requests and performing data analysis.
- **Web Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for interaction, request submission, and result viewing.
- **API Layer**: Enables communication between frontend and backend services via RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
- **Data Management**: Handles data storage and retrieval, ensuring integrity and performance.
- **Tool System**: Integrates tools for code editing, terminal operations, and data searching.
- **Preview Server**: Facilitates the preview of applications in a sandbox environment.
