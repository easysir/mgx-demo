# Project Summary
The MGX MVP project aims to develop an AI-driven collaborative system that integrates backend agents and frontend user interfaces. The system will facilitate user interactions through a platform that supports various functionalities, including real-time collaboration, code execution, and deployment management. The project focuses on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates core capabilities while allowing for future enhancements and scalability.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Agent System**: Manages multiple agents that handle various tasks such as user requests, data analysis, and system operations.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system, submit requests, and view results.
- **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend services using RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections.
- **Data Management**: Handles data storage and retrieval through databases, ensuring data integrity and performance.
